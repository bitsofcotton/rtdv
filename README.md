# rtdv
Try to get distant internal states by convergense speed difference ideally above the infinite accuracy.

# Description
We suppose Riemann measurable condition on somewhat continuous targets they refers dx scales' far small step can refer some another places of f.
This is from triangular transform's hidden structures.

So with any Stieljes tan\<a,x\> form, some of the numerical serieses convergense speed differences could refer somewhat another geometries internal states, this is only the possibility for us now.

So in fact we need another physical mechanisms however, the computer's calculation might refer somewhat another layer's internal states on us.
